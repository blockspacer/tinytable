# tinytable
an in-memory database
Tables can be configed with xmls, for example demo/conf/users.xml
The database supports many iterfaces, such as insert/get/set/add/dec/del/clear/find/size/begin/end/rank/queue_begin/queue_end...
The functions are all multhithread safe.
In the path demo, demo.cpp shows how to use it.
