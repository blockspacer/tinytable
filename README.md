# tinytable
an in-memory database.
Tables can be configured with xmls, for example demo/conf/users.xml.
The database supports many interfaces, such as insert/get/set/add/dec/del/clear/find/size/begin/end/rank/queue_begin/queue_end...
The functions are all multhi-thread safe.
In the path demo/, demo.cpp shows how to use tinytable.
